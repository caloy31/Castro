            The history of JavaScript came a long way from being an initial
            draft to the most used web development programming language. In the
            beginning there where a lot of chaos with the development of this
            programming language and one of those is that Microsoft refuses to
            add JavaScript in the Internet Explorer which was one of the most
            used browsers at that time. This chaos did not stop the development
            of JavaScript then it was submitted by Netscape to ECMA
            International, which sets the standards for the specification that
            other web browsers can implement in their system. This specification
            was called ECMAScript which released versions after the other. The
            name JavaScript was used to purposely attract developers who used
            java at that time. Further development to JavaScript led Jesse James
            Garret a UX Designer to partner up with AJAX technology to enable
            web pages to load faster and make websites more dynamic. After the
            meeting in July 2008 in Oslo ECMAScript became more developed which
            led to Javascript becoming the language of the web.

          <h2>What is Vanilla Javascript?</h2>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQUjEo9iqfo"
            ><img
              src="images/vanillajs.jpeg"
              alt="Vanilla JavaScript thumbnail"
          /></a>
          <p>
            Vanilla JavaScript is plain JavaScript without the frameworks and
            liabraries. Vanilla JavaScript utilitezes the javascript library
            that makes for faster and easiser javascript application
            development. Knowing what instrument you're working with is a
            crucial part of development since it makes you more aware of what
            you're doing and the consequences of each line of code.
